Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
	Trying to work with other APIs was extremely difficult. I feel like I understand Spotify's API really well now, but am still at a lost for every other API(at least while using angular). But that might just be me. I struggled with angular a lot. It messed with click and hover events in jQuery.
